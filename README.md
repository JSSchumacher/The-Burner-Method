# The Burner Method

### Description
The Burner Method is a lightweight project management framework built around the metaphor of a stovetop. It provides a simple yet powerful way to prioritize, track, and manage projects by assigning them to “burners” that represent focus, urgency, and resource allocation.

### Core Concept
Projects are categorized across four burners:
1. Primary Front Burner (PFB) – Singular daily focus (1/1 slot).
2. Secondary Front Burner (SFB) – Weekly/Monthly active projects (up to 4 slots).
3. Active Back Burner (ABB) – All other active projects (infinite).
4. Dormant Back Burner (DBB) – Paused, scrapped, or archived projects.

### Features
1. Heat Levels (HL): Adjust intensity of attention (Low → Max).
2. Time on Burner (ToB): Track how long projects have occupied a burner, helping prevent stagnation and burnout.
3. Fuel Source (FS): Manage resources—Time, Energy, Capital, and People—as the “fuel” that powers burners.

### System Dynamics:
1. Promotion/Demotion Cycle (projects move between burners).
2. Fuel Budgeting (ensures sustainable allocation).
3. Burnout Guard (alerts when demand exceeds supply).

## What Inspired The Project
I (as everything on my GitHub shows) love to orgianze things to better help me with projects. The Burner Method or TBM is a system that I invented back in 2023 and then later in 2025 started to digitize like the rest of my projects. TBM is meant to help me with three things; 1. Manage what projects I am currently working on, 2. Prevent burnout on a project, and 3. Keep track of all of my projects. Along with other stuff of course.
