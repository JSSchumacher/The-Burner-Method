# SCHEMA
### Name
**SCHEMA** - **S**chumacher **C**ontent **H**ierarchical **E**ncoding & **M**anagement **A**rchitecture

### Description
Custom file identification and organizational system designed to provide structured, human-readable, and context-aware file IDs for documents, ensuring clarity, traceability, and long-term maintainability. It incorporates metadata into the filename itself, making files self-descriptive even outside of a managed environment.

SCHEMA is a modular metadata architecture designed to unify how digital content is **named, versioned, archived, and formatted**. It provides a durable foundation for long-term personal projects, codebases, documentation, and archival systems.

## What Inspired The Project
I have always been overly organized. This is actually probably the third or fourth version of this (under different names). But it is just something that I can use to better organize my files, and now I can keep up with the structing easier with GitHub versions.
